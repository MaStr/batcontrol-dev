# Understanding the Decision Sensor

If MQTT is enabled, batcontrol publishes a **Decision** sensor to Home Assistant. It answers, in plain language, *why* batcontrol is currently charging, discharging, limiting PV charging, or holding the battery.

This page is for anyone running batcontrol who wants to read that sensor. For the underlying data model (reason codes, the decision journal, how to add a step), see [Decision Trace and Journal](https://mastr.github.io/batcontrol/development/decision-trace/index.md).

## Where to find it

The sensor's state is the text shown below; its attributes (click into the entity in Home Assistant) carry the full detail behind that one line, including every step that was checked during that control cycle.

## How to read the state

The state always has the same shape:

```
<Mode> [<value> W] - <why>
```

- **Mode** is what the inverter is doing: `Discharge Allowed`, `Avoid Discharge`, `Limit Battery Charge`, or `Charge from Grid`.
- **value** is the charge rate (force charge) or the PV charge limit (limit mode), in watts. The other two modes have no value.
- **why** is one sentence explaining the mode, built from the numbers batcontrol actually used to decide.

The sensor updates when something meaningful changes: a different mode, the charge rate / PV limit changing by 25 % or more, or a different reason. Otherwise it is refreshed every 15 minutes, so the numbers in the text are at most 15 minutes old. Small adjustments between evaluations do not create a new state right away.

If a configured limit changes the charge rate or the PV limit that batcontrol calculated (`max_grid_charge_rate`, `max_pv_charge_rate`, `min_pv_charge_rate`), the reason stays the same and the adjustment is added in brackets at the end of the text.

## Worked examples

These are real sensor states, not simplified paraphrases -- each one is exactly what `status_text()` produces for the numbers shown.

**Battery is allowed to discharge, there is enough energy**

> Discharge Allowed - usable energy (3500 Wh) exceeds the 1200 Wh reserved for upcoming more expensive hours

batcontrol is holding back 1200 Wh for a price spike it has already seen coming; the rest (3500 Wh usable) is free to use now.

**Battery is charged from the grid**

> Charge from Grid 2133 W - usable energy (900 Wh) is below the 2500 Wh reserved for upcoming more expensive hours, so 1600 Wh is charged from the grid

The 900 Wh left is not enough to cover the reserve for the next expensive hours, so the missing 1600 Wh is bought now while it is cheap, at a rate that fills the battery before the current price slot ends.

**Battery is held, but not charged from the grid**

> Avoid Discharge - battery is held for upcoming more expensive hours (usable 1300 Wh, reserve 1400 Wh); no grid charging: solar is forecast to cover the demand of the hours where it would pay off

The first part says why the battery is not discharged now: the energy is needed later, when power is more expensive than now. The second part says why it is not topped up from the grid either. Buying from the grid only pays off for hours that are clearly more expensive (by at least the minimum price difference), and here the solar forecast already covers those. Other endings are, for example, `the 8000 Wh grid charge limit is reached`, `no upcoming price is far enough above the current price to pay off` or `the missing 50 Wh are below the minimum charge amount`.

**Peak shaving slows down PV charging**

> Limit Battery Charge 1200 W - PV charging is limited so the battery is not full before 16:00 and room is kept for solar surplus in cheap-price hours

See [Peak Shaving](https://mastr.github.io/batcontrol/features/peak-shaving/index.md): without the limit, the battery would fill up early and stop absorbing solar, well before the configured target hour (16:00 here). The text names the active parts of peak shaving: the target hour (time based) and/or the cheap-price hours (price based).

**Solar feed-in limit (`Solarspitzengesetz`) absorption**

> Limit Battery Charge 900 W - PV charging is limited to keep battery room for the solar surplus above the 6000 W feed-in limit, which would otherwise be curtailed

Production is about to exceed the configured 6000 W feed-in limit; rather than curtailing (= wasting) the surplus, the battery keeps room for it and absorbs it.

**An external system blocks discharge**

> Avoid Discharge - an external system (such as evcc) requested that the battery not discharge

Today this is always evcc, holding the battery back while, for example, a car is charging.

**A Home Assistant / API request could not be applied as asked**

> Discharge Allowed - requested via the API or Home Assistant

The attributes' `inputs` show a `requested_mode` that differs from the `mode` actually applied: the requested mode (e.g. "Limit Battery Charge") had no limit configured, so batcontrol fell back to a safe mode instead.

**Forecasts could not be refreshed**

> Discharge Allowed - forecast data could not be refreshed for 185 seconds, so discharging is allowed as a safe fallback

batcontrol could not reach a forecast provider; after a short grace period it falls back to allowing discharge rather than guessing.

**Battery is full enough to always allow discharge**

> Discharge Allowed - battery holds 8200 Wh, above the always-allow-discharge level of 80% (8000 Wh)

Above the configured `always_allow_discharge_limit`, batcontrol always allows discharging, regardless of price.

## Reading the attributes

The attributes are the full trace of that control cycle: every rule that was checked, not only the one that decided the outcome. A rule that did not apply (`"outcome": "skipped"` or `"not_needed"`) is still listed -- that is how you can tell, for example, that peak shaving was evaluated and found nothing to do, rather than not running at all. The step that produced the sensor's state is named at the top level as `decided_by`, and its plain-language sentence is repeated there as `why`.
