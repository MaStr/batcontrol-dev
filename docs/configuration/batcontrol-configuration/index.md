This is the main control logic configuration:

```
timezone: Europe/Berlin #your time zone. not optional.
time_resolution_minutes: 60 # Time resolution for forecasts: 15 (quarter-hourly) or 60 (hourly). Default: 60
loglevel: debug
logfile_enabled: true
log_everything: false # if false debug messages from fronius.auth and urllib3.connectionpool will be suppressed
max_logfile_size: 200 #kB
logfile_path: logs/batcontrol.log
```

## Time Resolution (with 0.6.0)

```
time_resolution_minutes: 60
```

This parameter controls the time resolution for all forecasts (solar production, consumption, and electricity prices). Valid values are: * **60** (default) - Hourly intervals, backward compatible, lower memory usage * **15** - Quarter-hourly intervals, higher accuracy for dynamic tariffs, 4x more data points

**Recommendation**: Use **15 minutes** if your dynamic tariff provider offers quarter-hourly prices (e.g., some Tibber or energyforecast.de plans). Use **60 minutes** for standard hourly tariffs or if you want to minimize resource usage.

**Technical Details**:

- 15-min mode: 192 intervals per 48 hours (~8 KB per forecast)
- 60-min mode: 48 intervals per 48 hours (~2 KB per forecast)
- All forecast providers automatically adapt to the configured resolution
- MQTT topics publish data at the configured interval

## Timezone

This parameter is used to calculate the correct time for your location, as some datasources deliver UTC based timeslots. Valid values are [tz based(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## Logfile

### Logpath

```
logfile_path: logs/batcontrol.log
```

Describes where logfiles are stored. The path can be relative or absolute.

### Log Level

```
loglevel: debug
```

Increases or decreases the verbosity of log messages. Valid entries are

- error
- warning
- info
- debug

The recommended settings are `info` and `debug`. To reduce the noise in the default setup, we introduced

```
log_everything: false
```

Setting this to `true`, the logmessage from Fronius authentication logic + HTTP-Requests are visible in the logfile. These are very verbose messages, which is the reason to only enable it for debugging purposes.

### Enable / Disable logfile

```
logfile_enabled: true
```

This parameter is used to enable a pyhsical logfile. Console out is still active if this value is set to `false`. This can be useful in docker-based environments.

### Logsize

```
max_logfile_size: 200 #Kb
```

Amount of logsize bevore a logswitch is applied. The logs switches from log.1 to log.2 and back. Each file will be the size of `max_logfile_size`. This is used to avoid a filling up disk.

## Batcontrol alogrithm configuration

```
battery_control:
  min_price_difference: 0.05 
  min_price_difference_rel: 0.10
  always_allow_discharge_limit: 0.90
  max_charging_from_grid_limit: 0.89
  min_grid_charge_soc: 0.55 # optional: grid-charge to this SoC before expensive slots
  grid_charge_target_strategy: fixed # optional: fixed or forecast
  min_recharge_amount: 100
```

Details about the Price configuration can be found on [price difference calculation](https://mastr.github.io/batcontrol/features/price-difference-calculation/index.md) page. `always_allow_discharge_limit` & `max_charging_from_grid_limit` is explained [here](https://mastr.github.io/batcontrol/getting-started/how-batcontrol-works/index.md).

`min_grid_charge_soc` is optional. When set as a ratio, for example `0.55`, batcontrol grid-charges toward this target when charging is economical. Leave it unset to keep the default behavior.

`grid_charge_target_strategy` controls how `min_grid_charge_soc` is applied:

- `fixed` (default): grid-charge toward `min_grid_charge_soc` when charging is economical.
- `forecast`: use existing high-price-slot demand as an additional reserve. The target is roughly `min_grid_charge_soc` energy plus the calculated high-price required energy, capped by `max_charging_from_grid_limit`.

To also preserve this target as reserved energy during cheap/pre-expensive windows, enable the expert option `preserve_min_grid_charge_soc`. Without that expert option, the strategy affects grid recharge only and does not add extra discharge blocking.

If `min_grid_charge_soc` is higher than `max_charging_from_grid_limit`, grid charging cannot reach the configured minimum SoC target. Batcontrol will log a warning in this case; increase `max_charging_from_grid_limit` or lower `min_grid_charge_soc` so the settings correlate.

`min_recharge_amount` controls the minimum amount of Wh is needed to be recharged before batcontrol activates battery charging.

## Battery Control Expert Tuning Parameters

```
battery_control_expert:
  charge_rate_multiplier: 1.1
  soften_price_difference_on_charging: false
  soften_price_difference_on_charging_factor: 5
  round_price_digits: 4
  production_offset_percent: 1.0
  preserve_min_grid_charge_soc: false
```

These expert parameters allow fine-tuning of Batcontrol's behavior. See [Battery Control Expert](https://mastr.github.io/batcontrol/features/battery-control-expert/index.md) for detailed explanations of each parameter:
